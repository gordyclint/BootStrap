            <!-- About me Stuff -->
            <p>Hi! My name is Clint Gordy and I like to do a lot of wierd things. From gaming to
                sim racing to hockey, I like to stay busy and make sure life is always interesting.
            </p>

            <p>If you asked me three years ago what I were to do today, I wouldn't have told you
                software development. But life has a certain way of throwing very fun things at
                you and here I am, and here's my porfolio :)
            </p>

            <p>I was born and raised in Southern California in a small town called Rancho Cucamonga.
                If you've heard of it in spaces beyond the popular TV show Workaholics, I would be
                very surprised. For college, I went to school at the University of California, Santa
                Barbara, where I studied Global and International Studies. Haven't really done much Workaholics
                related to that, but hey, that's life.
            </p>

            <p>I am really passionate about building things into a living, breathing reality. I'm not the best
                at it now, but as I continue to grow, I can't wait to see where this profession takes me. As they
                say back home, I'm stoked to learn more!
            </p>
